              <p>
                First and foremost, excellent work on successfully deploying the microservices that power the ShellCon platform! This is no small feat, and demonstrates your technical prowess. Before diving into the challenges, take a moment to verify that all systems are operational by using the API call buttons in the Control Panel below. Each button connects to a different service endpoint, allowing you to confirm that all components are communicating properly.

              <p>
                This year's ShellCon features a revolutionary Smart Aquarium system built with Rust and deployed on Shuttle. 
                The system uses advanced sensors and analytics to maintain perfect environments for rare and valuable crab, 
                lobster, and shrimp specimens from around the world.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
              However, just hours before the convention opens, several performance issues have been detected in the backend services. 
              As a newly recruited Rustacean engineer, you've been called in to optimize these systems before the doors open to 
              the public. The organizers are in a pinchâ€”quite literally, as the convention's mascot, a giant Coconut Crab 
              named Ferris, is anxiously clicking his claws at the mounting technical issues!
            </p>

              <p className="font-semibold text-orange-300">The Smart Aquarium Architecture</p>

              <p>
                Your mission is to solve a series of challenges that will optimize these services, demonstrating your 
                Rust backend expertise while learning valuable patterns for high-performance distributed systems. 
                Each fix brings you one step closer to ensuring the safety of these incredible creatures and saving 
                the reputation of ShellCon.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
              Examine each challenge, implement the suggested optimizations, and watch as the system's performance improves under "System Status". 
              The convention opens soonâ€”the clock is ticking and the crustaceans are getting crabby!
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Remember, in the world of Rust performance optimization, you're not just a developerâ€”you're a Rustacean on a mission!
