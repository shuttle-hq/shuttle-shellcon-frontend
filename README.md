# ü¶Ä ShellCon Frontend - Smart Aquarium Dashboard üêö

## üîç Overview

This repository contains the frontend application for the ShellCon Smart Aquarium Dashboard. It's designed to work with three Rust backend microservices deployed using Shuttle. The application provides an interactive interface for solving shell scripting challenges in the context of managing a smart aquarium system.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- A deployed instance of the ShellCon backend services on Shuttle Cloud
  - **Backend Repository**: [https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-shellcon](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-shellcon)

## üîß Backend Services

The frontend communicates with three separate backend microservices:

1. **Aqua Monitor** (Port 8000): Environmental monitoring system and challenge #1 validation
2. **Species Hub** (Port 8001): Species database management and challenge #2 validation
3. **Aqua Brain** (Port 8002): System status reporting and challenges #3-4 validation

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Services to Shuttle Cloud

Before setting up the frontend, you need to deploy the backend services to Shuttle Cloud:

1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-shellcon.git
   cd shuttle-shellcon
   ```

2. Deploy the services to Shuttle Cloud:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're at the root of the rust project where the shuttle.toml file is located
   shuttle deploy
   ```

3. After successful deployment, Shuttle will provide URLs for each service. Note these URLs as you'll need them for the frontend configuration.

### Step 2: Configure the Frontend

1. Clone this frontend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-shellcon-frontend.git
   cd shuttle-shellcon-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.prod` file in the project root with your Shuttle-deployed backend URLs:
   ```bash
   # Create the .env.prod file (this file is in .gitignore and won't exist in the cloned repo)
   touch .env.prod
   ```

4. Add your Shuttle-deployed backend URLs to the `.env.prod` file:
   ```env
   # Replace with your actual Shuttle-deployed service URLs
   VITE_AQUA_MONITOR_URL=https://your-aqua-monitor-service.shuttleapp.app
   VITE_SPECIES_HUB_URL=https://your-species-hub-service.shuttleapp.app
   VITE_AQUA_BRAIN_URL=https://your-aqua-brain-service.shuttleapp.app
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Frontend with Cloud Backend

1. Start the frontend with the production configuration:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:prod
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

   This will run the frontend locally but connect to your cloud-deployed backend services.

### Step 4: Verify the Connection

1. Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:8080`
2. Ensure all three backend services are connected properly
3. Verify that you can view and interact with all challenges

## üíª Running with Local Backend

To run the backend services locally:

1. Clone the backend repository if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-shellcon.git
   cd shuttle-shellcon
   ```

2. Start all services locally with Shuttle:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're at the root of the rust project where the shuttle.toml file is located
   shuttle run
   ```

   The services will be available at:
   - Aqua Monitor: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Species Hub: `http://localhost:8001`
   - Aqua Brain: `http://localhost:8002`

3. Create a `.env.localhost` file in your frontend project:
   ```bash
   # Create the .env.localhost file (this file is in .gitignore and won't exist in the cloned repo)
   touch .env.localhost
   ```

4. Add the local backend URLs to the `.env.localhost` file:
   ```env
   VITE_AQUA_MONITOR_URL=http://localhost:8000
   VITE_SPECIES_HUB_URL=http://localhost:8001
   VITE_AQUA_BRAIN_URL=http://localhost:8002
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
   ```

5. Start the frontend with the local configuration:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:localhost
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

## üîÑ Switching Between Local and Cloud Backends

### To Use Local Backend

1. Start the backend services locally:
   ```bash
   cd shuttle-shellcon
   shuttle run
   ```

2. Run the frontend with local configuration:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:localhost
   ```

### To Use Cloud Backend

1. If not already deployed, deploy the backend to Shuttle Cloud:
   ```bash
   cd shuttle-shellcon
   shuttle deploy
   ```

2. Make sure your `.env.prod` file has the correct URLs:
   ```env
   VITE_AQUA_MONITOR_URL=https://your-aqua-monitor-service.shuttleapp.app
   VITE_SPECIES_HUB_URL=https://your-species-hub-service.shuttleapp.app
   VITE_AQUA_BRAIN_URL=https://your-aqua-brain-service.shuttleapp.app
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
   ```

3. Run the frontend with the production configuration:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:prod
   ```

In both cases, the application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Connection Errors**:
   - Verify that all three backend services are running (check the Shuttle dashboard or run `shuttle logs --latest`)
   - Ensure the URLs in your `.env.localhost` or `.env.prod` file are correct
   - Check the browser console for specific error messages
   - Make sure you're using the correct command (`npm run dev:localhost` for local backend, `npm run dev:prod` for cloud backend)

2. **CORS Issues**:
   - If you see CORS errors in the console, ensure the backend services are configured to accept requests from your frontend domain
   - For local development, the backend services should allow requests from `http://localhost:8080`
   - Try clearing your browser cache or using an incognito/private window

3. **Challenge Validation Problems**:
   - Check the backend logs for any errors: `shuttle logs --latest`
   - Verify that you're following the challenge instructions exactly as specified
   - Make sure you've completed all the prerequisites for each challenge
   - Check if your solution matches the expected format (case-sensitive, exact spacing, etc.)

5. **Frontend Loading Issues**:
   - If challenges don't load, check the Network tab in your browser's developer tools
   - Verify that the API requests are being sent to the correct URLs
   - Try restarting both the frontend and backend services
